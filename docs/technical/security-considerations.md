# Security Considerations

## Data Protection

### Personal Data Handling
- GDPR compliance requirements
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure data processing procedures
- Right to erasure implementation
- Data portability features

### API Security
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack mitigation

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management
- Password security policies
- Account lockout mechanisms

## Infrastructure Security

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Encrypted database connections
- Regular security updates
- Backup encryption
- Access logging and monitoring

### API Endpoint Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Request validation
- Error handling (no sensitive data exposure)
- Security headers implementation

### Third-Party Integrations
- OAuth 2.0 implementation
- Secure token storage
- Token refresh mechanisms
- API key management
- Webhook signature verification

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance
- Consent management
- Data processing records
- Privacy by design

- COPPA (children's privacy)
- CAN-SPAM (email marketing)
- CCPA (California privacy)

## Security Monitoring

### Threat Detection
- Anomaly detection systems
