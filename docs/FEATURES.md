  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const createCampaign = async (data: CampaignData) => {
    // Implementation

  return { campaigns, loading, createCampaign, updateCampaign };
};
```

### Real-time Features

```typescript
// Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('campaigns')
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'campaigns',
      filter: `created_by=eq.${user.id}`
    }, (payload) => {
      // Handle real-time campaign updates
    })
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [user.id]);
```

// Efficient data fetching with selective loading
const { data: campaigns } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .select('id, name, status, metrics, created_at')
  .eq('created_by', userId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(20);
