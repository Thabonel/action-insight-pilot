- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement responsive designs by default

### Component Structure
- Create focused, single-responsibility components
- Use custom hooks for business logic
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow the composition pattern

### State Management
- Use React Query for server state
- Use React Context for app-wide state
- Keep component state local when possible
